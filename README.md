# DeepSleep

- This is English version(although a lot of google translationðŸ˜‚), for china user [ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆ](https://github.com/Jasper-1024/DeepSleep/blob/dev/README/README_zh_cn.md)

- DeepSleep is a Xposed module. It can limit the background behavior of apps and reduce the power consumption of apps in the background.
  - Block acquire [wakelock](https://developer.android.com/training/scheduling/wakelock) and [alarms](https://developer.android.com/training/scheduling/alarms) to prevent redundant wake-ups.
  - Block start [services](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/services) to reduce memory consumption.
  - Block [sync](https://developer.android.com/training/sync-adapters?hl=zh-cn) to prevent redundant wake-ups.

- EDxposed/LSPosed scope Select the application to be limited.

- Serious warning
  - Using deepsleep is not recommended if your device has no standby power consumption problems.
  - Using deepsleep to limit the application may cause unusual problems with the application.
    - IM may experience message delays
    - Music player may not play on the lock screen
    - Other exceptions caused by restricting the background behavior of the app.
